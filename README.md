# Project One

## Description

This is our team's first project for UA's coding bootcamp. It is a virtual Kanban Board with two distinct "attitudes" to choose from depending on if you want sweet, encouraging messages or sarcatic, biting motivation. 

## Installation

To install this project all you need to do is download the repository and open index.html using your browser of choice. Alternatively, you could just go to the github page for this website.

## Usage

To use this project, choose your preffered "attitude" from the homepage.

Then, crate new cards in each category depending on if you want to mark down a task as "To-Do", "In-Progress", or "Done". You may then use the buttons on the cards to move them to each different catogory or delete them. You may toggle between attitudes by using the links in the top right-hand corner.

When you mark a task done, a celabratory gif will pop up! Click anywhere to dismiss.

To modify this project, you will need to reference the documentation for Pure CSS for the base styling, jQuery for many of the script functions, the Quotes.rest API, and the GIPHY API.
